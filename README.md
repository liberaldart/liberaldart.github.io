This project is the proof of concept for a collaboration model being developed
at Ghumakkad by collaboration among community.

Anyone can think of a project of collaboration and take it through exploration
at Ghumakkad with the collaboration model.

For instance, I can take a course at Coursera.org and publish it for taking
by the local community in collaboration with the international community. Individuals 
can be a part of this at Ghumakkad by being present here or through web conferencing.
