# liberaldart.github.io: First draft of book

LiberalDart is the word I associate with all that I stand for. When i was a small kid, I was trying to make sense of what the world is. I kept looking around and made sense out of perceptions of people, as in what they think about anything and why do they think that way. 
I asked a lot of questions and slowly and steadily kept fighting to get the answers. My dad gave me my answers for most of kiddish questions until a day when he gave up and handed me over the torch.

I asked him how can I come first, I want to stand first in the class, I study hard but I still don't come first. What should I do? He said, go ask for friends who stand first in the class.
I said, but they are not my friends. We play together but they are not my friends. He pushed me hard to think in that direction. He said, just go upto them and ask the straight blunt question. Ask them how do they study that they stand first in the class.

He pushed me so hard that I went to the senior kid from a grade higher. I was in 9th grade. I went to Hrishikesh Bhaiyya. I asked him the straight question. 
I said, I study hard, I don't mind studying but I want to stand first in the class. How do I do that?
He said, read all the books from page one to the last page. Never just solve just classwork and homework and get done with it. But instead, after finishing the homeworks, or before it read the whole book end to end. You will enjoy it.

From that day onwards, I read the complete history book, geography, civics, chemistry, physics and mathematics. I read all the books slowly and steadily. After just a couple of chapters I used to get glued to the books that I used to read. 
In standard 9th I stood first in the class.

I got into a habit of reading. But only course books. Since that day, I read all the books I possibly could read that where anywhere related to my course materials. I stood first in my section every year after that day when Hrishikesh Bhaiyya told me how to read.

Now I had another question. I was standing first in the section but still not in the class. In my class there were 2 sections until 10th. Till 10th I stood first in my class but when i went to class 11th I started standing 2nd. I was okay with it but it raised a question in my mind.

What should I do now to stand first in the whole section. I went ahead and asked the same question to my classmate who stood first in the class. He said, he doesn't know, his dad teaches him.
I went to my dad and said, I am clueless now. I told him what went with the interaction that I had with Rohan the other day. 
My dad said, I can teach you what I can. But now you need to find out your answers yourself. You need to go and talk to people who you think can help you. 
He encouraged me to ride my bycycle 4-5 kilometers to Rohan's house and play with him and ask him all my questions. I interacted with Rohan. I went to him house every other day.
Then I went ahead and talked to the student whom Rohan was inspired with. I spoke with Abhishek Bhaiyya. I spoke with him dad.I asked all I could about how do I prepare for IIT. Now my mission was, not standing first in the class but to get into IITs. Thanks to Rohan and Abhishek Bhaiyya and Abhishek Bhaiyya's and Rohan's family who allowed me their company. There are advantages of being a kid.

We had to move to Gujarat and then eventually to Delhi. This all took a lot of time and patience and I could never go beyond Screening examination of IITs. But I persevered. I eventually was ready to go and study mathematics from an average college. Because Mathematics inspired me to go further in my quest. There is always a problem to solve more complex and more fun that the previous problem.

But luckily I got into DCE. Thanks to my family for all they support I got.
I relaxed. I enjoyed my college. I studied enough to clear all my exams and get through most of my engineering days without a lot of hardships. 
I enjoyed programming. It was just like mathematics. There is always a more complex and more fun programming problem to solve. But I forgot my biggest lesson that had brought me here. What I can do better? Find out a person who can answer my question and ask him for help. Its not easy. It takes a lot of pushing.

Now I don't have the push. I just had the torch that I was given. The torh is the idea that tells: "go and ask the question". Every once in a while I pushed myself. I persevered but I forgot to go and do the ask. I could have gone and asked my senior who went into Google. I could have asked him, what should I read now that I can also go into Google. I could have been in Google had I gone and asked Shwetabh Mittal about how to study so that you go to Google.

I could not go to Google the same way I could not go to IIT. But I went to DCE because of the momentum I got through IIT preparation.
The same IIT momentum took me through Conexant interview, then motorola interview and then the momentum died. I started having my fun. I moved around Hyderabad. Learnt how to ride motorcycle, went on treks, hikes enjoyed my life to the fullest. Then I went to USA on H1b visa. Re-gathered the momentum and worked hard until I could not take it any more. 
I wanted to go higher but the road I was taking was too boring. I wanted to do something better.

I could see how everyone elese around me can do something better. I was searching for an inspiration to whom I can go to and talk to. I was searching for another Rohan, Abhishek. I could find a lot of them all around me. I could see a world of successful people who are successful for various reasons.

I want to bring a change into the world of education. I want every child out there to have a guardian who can encourage him to go and do the ask. I want this in every teacher. I want every courage to be fed into any individual so that he can persevere and stand up and use the momentum to roll farther that he would had he not have the momentum. That's way I choose to study Artificial intelligence(machine learning), computer programming, how to make a web application that can scale, how to write a book, how to record a video and how to do public speaking, so that I can reach out to everyone out there to ask them to do the ask.
